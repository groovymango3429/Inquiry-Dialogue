Progress for Whom? A Dialogue on Technology's Promise and Peril

Characters of the Dialogue
Techne, a philosopher who believes technology controls humanity more than humanity controls technology.
Historia, a historian who studies technology's unintended consequences and political dimensions.
Futurus, an optimist who sees technology as a path to empowerment and liberation.
Synthesis, a mechanical engineering student seeking to understand progress on deeper terms.

Scene: Late afternoon in a university library. Techne sits reading Heidegger near a window. Historia enters carrying a stack of historical accounts, followed by Futurus with a tablet displaying colorful digital art. They gather around a table where Synthesis has spread out various books and articles.

Synthesis: Thank you all for meeting me here. I've been wrestling with a question that feels both simple and impossibly complex: Is technological progress always progress? As someone entering mechanical engineering, I need to understand what I'm actually contributing to.

Techne: Your question assumes technology is something we control, something we direct toward progress. But what if the opposite is true? What if technology, as Heidegger argued, "enframes" us—transforms everything, including ourselves, into standing reserve, resources to be optimized?

Futurus: That sounds rather bleak, Techne. Surely you're not suggesting we abandon innovation altogether?

Techne: Not abandon—understand. Ellul showed us that technology develops with its own momentum, accelerating faster than our ethical deliberation can keep pace. Once something becomes possible, it becomes inevitable. We don't control this process; it controls us.

Historia: I find truth in what you say, Techne, but I think you're missing something crucial. Technology doesn't just have its own momentum—it embodies human choices, political structures, even prejudices. Winner demonstrated this brilliantly with his example of the low bridges in New York, deliberately designed to exclude buses and thereby exclude low-income people from certain neighborhoods.

Synthesis: So you're saying technology carries politics within its very design?

Historia: Precisely. Consider the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Yes, it represented a magnificent scientific achievement, a triumph of physics and engineering. But as Hersey's account reveals, it also meant unfathomable human suffering. Or look at industrial agriculture—we solved food scarcity but created environmental devastation and labor exploitation. The Lancet documents these consequences thoroughly.

Futurus: But you're both focusing only on the failures! What about the communities reimagining technology as liberation? Afrofuturism shows us that not all technological narratives are dystopian. Some envision technology as a path to empowerment, a way to transcend historical oppression and build better futures.

Techne: Imagining better futures is admirable, Futurus, but imagination doesn't change the fundamental relationship. In Brave New World, Huxley showed us how technology that eliminates pain and conflict can simultaneously strip away individuality and authentic emotion. Efficiency becomes oppression.

Futurus: Huxley wrote dystopian fiction, not prophecy. And yes, Black Mirror presents terrifying scenarios like "Nosedive," where social rating systems turn life into a popularity contest. But these are warnings, not inevitabilities. They exist to help us make better choices about technological development.

Historia: That's where you're both circling something important. These narratives—both optimistic and pessimistic—shape how we actually develop technology. The Amnesty International report on AI surveillance shows this clearly. Facial recognition could be used to find missing children or could enable authoritarian control. The technology itself is neutral; the application reflects our values and power structures.

Techne: But can we truly say the technology is neutral when, as I said, it develops faster than our ethical frameworks? The momentum carries us forward regardless of our intentions.

Synthesis: I've been listening to all of you, and I notice something. Techne, you're right that technology shapes how we see the world—that's undeniable. Historia, you've shown me that technologies carry politics and create mixed outcomes, solving immediate problems while generating new ethical dilemmas. And Futurus, you remind us that human imagination matters, that we can envision empowering futures rather than only dystopian ones.

Futurus: It sounds like you're beginning to see that none of us holds the complete truth.

Synthesis: Exactly. My question was flawed from the start. I asked, "Is technological progress always progress?" But the real question is: "Progress for whom, and defined by what values?" Technology isn't inherently good or bad—it's shaped by human choices, cultural narratives, and power dynamics.

Historia: That's a more sophisticated framework, but how does it help you in practical terms? You're becoming an engineer. You'll be creating these technologies.

Synthesis: It means I need to ask different questions at every stage of development. Not just "Can we build this?" but "Who benefits? Who might be harmed? What unintended consequences might emerge?" Winner's bridges, the atomic bomb, industrial agriculture—these weren't created by evil people. They emerged from narrow thinking about progress.

Techne: You're beginning to understand enframing then. Technology reveals the world to us in particular ways, and we must remain conscious of those framings rather than accepting them as natural or inevitable.

Synthesis: Yes, but I'd add that we can resist those framings through intentional design. If artifacts have politics, as Winner argues, then we can intentionally embed different politics—equity, sustainability, human dignity. We can slow down Ellul's momentum through collective ethical deliberation.

Futurus: Now you're speaking my language! This is what Afrofuturist thinkers understand—that we can imagine and build technologies that reflect liberatory values rather than oppressive ones. The future isn't predetermined.

Historia: Though we must learn from history's lessons. Every technological solution has created new problems. Industrial agriculture, nuclear weapons, AI surveillance—the pattern is clear. We need what you might call ethical imagination, the ability to anticipate consequences before they manifest.

Synthesis: Which brings me to a synthesis of all your positions. Techne, you've taught me to question the assumption that technology is merely a tool we control—it shapes us even as we shape it. Historia, you've grounded this in real consequences and shown how power structures embed themselves in technological design. Futurus, you've reminded me that we're not helpless, that conscious imagination and intentional design can guide technology toward more equitable ends.

Techne: And what will you do with this synthesis?

Synthesis: I'll carry it into my engineering work. I'll advocate for slower, more deliberate development processes that include diverse voices and consider long-term consequences. I'll resist the narrative that innovation must always accelerate, that what's possible must become inevitable. And I'll work to embed different values into the technologies I help create.

Futurus: That sounds hopeful, but also humble. You're not claiming you can solve everything.

Synthesis: No, because as Voline wrote, we must juxtapose each fragment of truth with others, seeking always to discover new parts and make them form one whole. This conversation has given me a critical lens, not a final answer. Progress isn't inherent in technological advancement—it's something we must actively create through conscious choices guided by questions of equity, consequence, and human flourishing.

Historia: In other words, the answer to your original question is that technological progress is only progress when it serves human dignity, when it emerges from ethical deliberation, and when it acknowledges and addresses its own limitations and unintended consequences.

Techne: A provisional answer, but a thoughtful one. Though I maintain that enframing will continue to challenge your best intentions.

Synthesis: I accept that challenge. It means staying vigilant, questioning assumptions, and remembering that the technologies I help build will shape how future generations see and experience their world. That's both a tremendous responsibility and an opportunity.

Futurus: Then perhaps the real progress isn't in the technologies themselves, but in developing the wisdom to guide them toward genuinely better futures.

Synthesis: Yes. And wisdom begins by asking better questions—not "Is progress inevitable?" but "What kind of progress do we want, and who gets to decide?" Those are questions I'll carry far beyond this library.

[The four gather their materials as evening settles over the library, their conversation having transformed a simple question into a complex, nuanced understanding—a synthesis greater than its individual parts, yet incorporating each essential piece.]
