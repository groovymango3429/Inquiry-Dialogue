Progress or Illusion? Rethinking Technological Advancement
	My first thread begins with the broad question of what philosophers have said about technology. I started by searching questions like, “philosophy of technology” and “technological determinism” using websites like Google Scholar and JSTOR. I searched these threads, aiming to understand how philosophical people thought about technology and the future of it. 
	The first source I found was The Question Concerning Technology by Martin Heidegger. Heidegger argues that technology doesn’t just help people control nature, instead, it “enframes” society , turning everything, including humans into resources to be optimized. One thing that surprised me about this article was the age, even though this article is 80 years old, it still feels relevant today. His idea that technology shapes the way we see the world challenged my view of technology as just hardware. 
	My second source was The Technological Society by Jacques Ellul. Ellul suggested that technology develops with its own momentum, getting faster and more efficient exponentially, sometimes past our ethical deliberation. This idea implies that once something is possible, it may be inevitable. After reading this source, I started to realize that "progress" as we know it, might not be something we control, but something that controls us. 
	My third text was Do Artifacts Have Politics? by Langdon Winner. Winner suggests that technology and the advancement of it, can embody political choices even if we think it might not. For example, low bridges in New York are designed to exclude buses from the area, which inevitably reduces the amount of low-income people in the area. This text and example allowed me to see how even “neutral” designs can enforce inequality. 
	Based on this thread, I want to research case studies where technological advancement created unwanted results. I also think it would be interesting to look into how our culture shapes the way we invent and produce new technologies. This leads to my second thread: history. 
	For this thread, I searched for terms like “unintended consequences of technology,” and “atomic bomb ethics.” I used Google Scholar and ProQuest. For this thread, I wanted real-world examples that could reveal the historical stakes of technological progress.
	My first source was Hiroshima by John Hersey. This account of the aftermath of the atomic bomb shows the ethical costs of technological triumph. While the bomb represented a great scientific achievement for humanity, it also caused massive human suffering and death. Reading this shifted my focus from abstract ethics to a real world tangible human consequence. 
	A second major source was a journal article from The Lancet on the public health consequences of industrial agriculture. This source highlights how technical innovations that once solved food scarcity have contributed to environmental devastation and labor exploitation. This concept of solving one problem while creating others challenges my view that technology is mostly net-positive
	A third useful source was a report from Amnesty International on AI surveillance and privacy. With innovations in technology and AI, facial recognition has allowed governments and agencies to recognize anyone, anywhere. This has allowed technology to become a tool for authoritarian control. This example makes Winner’s earlier arguments come alive: technologies can carry political power.
	What impressed me most across these sources is how frequently technologies deliver mixed outcomes. Sometimes they’ll solve humanity's immediate problems but will generate new ethical dilemmas.  
	I now wanted to explore not just the literal effects of technology but instead the stories we tell about them. This brought me to literature and media. 
	For this thread, I used terms like “technology in dystopian literature,” “utopia vs dystopia technology,” and “Black Mirror Analysis.” I researched databases for literary criticisms and even some popular media reviews. This thread emerged from the previous threads, shifting from what technology does to how we imagine what technology could do in the future. 
	My first source was Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. In this novel, technology eliminates all forms of pain and conflict but also strips away individuality and emotions. What impressed me was how “progress” in the novel is experienced and looked at as oppression, even when it’s efficient. 
	A second source was the TV series Black Mirror, which dramatizes futuristic technologies. For example, an episode named “Nosedive” shows how rating based social systems can turn an everyday life into a popularity contest. I find it terrifying how plausible these scenarios felt, with technologies like social media , this system seems entirely possible. 
	My third source was an article on Afrofuturism from Duke University Press, which showed me that not all narratives about technology are dystopian. Some communities try to imagine technology as a path to a better, more advanced future. This was refreshing after so many stories of dystopian horror.
	This thread allowed me to realize that technological progress isn’t just about what is invented, but also about how we frame those inventions. 
	After completing this thread, I now have a more complex view of my question. The issue isn’t exactly whether the advancement of technology is good or bad. Instead, it’s about imagination and the consequences of our imagination. I planned to revisit earlier threads to refine my thesis and clarify what the word “progress” really means. 

Summative Reflection
When I began this project, my question “Is technological progress always progress?” seemed simple. I expected to research arguments either for or against the idea that technology is naturally beneficial. What I found was actually more complicated than I could've imagined. Throughout my three research threads, philosophical analysis, historical case studies, and cultural narratives, I learned that “progress” is not neutral. Progress in technology is shaped by power structures, narratives, and unintended consequences .
The philosophical thread gave me the language to speak what I had only felt partially before. Heidegger, Ellul, and Winner made me question the assumption that technology is just a tool. These ideas helped me see that technology shapes how we live our lives. Without this conceptual start, my later research would’ve had no basis. 
The historical thread grounded those ideas in reality. Hersey’s account of Hiroshima forced me to confront the human suffering and death behind technological advancements. The Lancet article on agriculture and the Amnesty International report on AI surveillance showed that technological solutions come with long term costs. This made it clear that researching and evaluating technology requires an ethical imagination. 
The cultural narratives thread expanded my understanding further. Works like Brave New World and Black Mirror revealed how humans imagine technology shaping our futures, often looking at the dark side. But Afrofuturism showed me a different angle, an angle that allows people to look at scientific breakthroughs can empower and reimagine futures beyond dystopian societies. This made me revise my question once again, from “Is technological progress always progress?” to “Progress for who, and defined by what values?”
If I could give advice to my earlier self in this essay, I would say "don't rush to find an answer.” Instead, try letting the question shift around. The most meaningful part of this project wasn’t arriving at a conclusion but instead allowing my understanding to change through different perspectives. I also learned different types of researching skills, how to follow citations, refine search terms, and balance scholarly and non-scholary sources. Going “two clicks down” into sources revealed deeper debates than a single surface level search. 
In the end, I didn’t find a single answer, but I did develop a clear , and critical lens. In my opinion, technological progress isn’t inherently good or bad, it’s instead shaped by human choices, cultural narratives, and power dynamics. As someone who is entering the technological field in mechanical engineering, that is a lesson I’ll carry beyond this project.
